			<p>I love the uniqueness of this design. It gets a lot of compliments and also has people looking harder at the coins since it spins and they look at the coins longer. Seems very sturdy so far with a lot of people coming in and spinning it around.</p>

			<p>I found this display as a gift for my husband's 45th anniversary of being shot in Vietnam. Every year I try to find an appropriate gift to recognize the fact he lived (although blinded). This product was made by a disable Vet so it had special meaning. Everyone loves it!!!! Buy one</p>

			<p>This holds my business cards and my memories of a long and sometimes less than perfect military career. It is a nice way to share my experiences with my clients without feeling or sounding phony. They simply ask me how I received certain coins and the conversation starts from there. It has also allowed me to connect with others that want to share their military stories.
			Great product classy but not flashy and a good bargain.</p>

			<p>I bought this as a gift for someone who collects display poker chips and other things. He really liked the gift, said it was well made and "something different." As a buyer, I found it positive that the pyramid is made by Veterans.</p>

			<p>This pyramid is so much bigger and better then I thought it would be! It's beautiful!!! My husband is retierd from the USAF and this pyramid holds his most treasured military coins with pride! I will be buying another one for sure! I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to show there coins off with pride!</p>

			<p>My son really loves this display. It's not your typical slot in a piece of wood. And I especially liked that it was made by veterens and they shipped to an APO address.</p>
