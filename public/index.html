			<p>I had been looking for a way to display my small collection of challenge coins. All I could find were cases, which do not work well on a desk. This is the perfect size and shape for the corner of my desk, plus it serves as a business card holder as well. Perfect solution!</p>

			<p>This holds my business cards and my memories of a long and sometimes less than perfect military career. It is a nice way to share my experiences with my clients without feeling or sounding phony. They simply ask me how I received certain coins and the conversation starts from there. It has also allowed me to connect with others that want to share their military stories.

					 If you've gotten this far on our site, you're more than interested and deserve a special thanks--either for your direct service to our country or indirect service, which is just as special, as a spouse or family member of a service member. I've proudly served and have designed a product I'm proud to see on a soldier's, sailor's, airman's, marine's or veteran's desk. Each one of their coins represents a specific time and event in their life as a military veteran. I designed this product with that in mind; simply rotate the pyramid, pick up a soldier's coin and it will definitely have a story behind it--if it can be told (LOL)--enjoy
